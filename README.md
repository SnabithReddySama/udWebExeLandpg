# udWebExeLandpg
Udemy completeWeb landing page exercise. (Andrei Neagoie)

-Used creative tim free templates (nav with icons(pe-7s icons) & coming ssoon)
-Done: https://snabith2.github.io/udWebExeLandpg/

-A deleted contact( deleted as a campaign admin) can't resubscribe(is this limited to the current campaign?). 
-A contact can be resubscribed(either by the admin or by the contact) if not deleted (archived contacts can be resubscribed!).
-Realised that there are info resources at mailchimp home (don't know how to reach that page from the dashboard).
-Not so good looking on firefox. Didn't include mozilla specific css. So, works well on chrome and I can update this.
